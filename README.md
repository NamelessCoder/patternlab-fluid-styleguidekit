Pattern Lab Fluid Engine: Styleguide Kit
========================================

This is a style guide kit for the design tool [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io) designed to integrate with the
[Pattern Lab Fluid Edition](https://github.com/NamelessCoder/patternlab-fluid-editiion).

**Do not install this package manually - it should always be installed via the [Pattern Lab Fluid Edition](https://github.com/NamelessCoder/patternlab-fluid-editiion)**

This work was kindly sponsored by [Busy Noggin](http://busynoggin.com/).
